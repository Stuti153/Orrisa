  <p>Odisha , is an Indian state located in Eastern India. It is the 8th largest state by area, and the 11th largest by population. 
      The state has the third largest population of Scheduled Tribes in India.
     It neighbours the states of West Bengal and Jharkhand to the north, Chhattisgarh to the west, and Andhra Pradesh to the south. 
     Odisha has a coastline of 485 kilometres (301 miles) along the Bay of Bengal.
     The ancient kingdom of Kalinga, which was invaded by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka (which was again won back from them by king Kharavela)
      in 261 BCE resulting in the Kalinga War
      (The lethal war with Kalinga transformed the vengeful Emperor Ashoka into a stable and peaceful emperor, 
      and he became a patron of Buddhism), coincides with the borders of modern-day Odisha.[18] The modern boundaries of Odisha 
      were demarcated by the British Indian government when Orissa Province was established on 1 April 1936, consisting of the Odia-speaking 
      districts of Bihar and Orissa Province.[18] The first of April is celebrated as Utkala Dibasa. Cuttack 
      was made the capital of the region by Anantavarman Chodaganga in c. 1135,[20] after which the city was used as the capital by many rulers, 
      through the British era until 1948. 
     Thereafter, Bhubaneswar became the capital of Odisha.

  <p1>Odia Cuisine is the cuisine of the state of Odisha. 
  It has developed over time with local culture and agriculture and hence has its distinct items and practices. 
  Odisha borders both north Indian states and south Indian states and consequently is similar to the cuisines of South and North India.
  Compared to other regional Indian cuisines, Odia cuisine uses less oil and is less spicy while nonetheless remaining flavourful.
  Rice is the staple food of this region. Mustard oil is used in some dishes as the cooking medium, but ghee (made of cow's milk) is preferred in temples.
   In old times food was traditionally served on banana leaves or disposable plates made of sal leaves.
Odia cooks, particularly from the Puri region, were much sought after due to their ability to cook food in accordance with Hindu scriptures.
 During the 19th century, many Odia cooks were employed in Bengal and they took many Odia dishes with them.
 This period also saw a heavy demand for Brahmin cooks, leading many Odia cooks to fake their castes.
Yoghurt is used in dishes. Many sweets of the region are based on chhena (cheese).
